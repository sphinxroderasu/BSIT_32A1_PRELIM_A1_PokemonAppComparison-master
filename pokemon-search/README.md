The test.html is to provides the structure of the webpage and links to the JavaScript and CSS files. Like(form, input, button, and result display area).
While style.css is to improve the visual appearance by setting the background color, font styles, and button designs, ensuring a clean and user-friendly layout. And the script.js file adds interactivity by handling form submissions, fetching Pokemon data from the PokeAPI, and dynamically updating the webpage to display the Pokemon's name, image, height, weight, and type.
To add a conclusion they work as a team they have different roles like html  is the base css is the color or the design while javascript is the mind to take control. HTML alone would be plain, CSS alone would just be decoration, and JavaScript alone wouldnâ€™t have anything to control. But when they work together, they create a fun and working Pokemon search website!
